<p>My name is Bryan Napier.  I am a Technical Architect with AT&amp;T Business Solutions, Hosting &amp; Application Services.  In this role I provide consulting services to AT&amp;T customers around Microsoft Technologies, primarily SharePoint and .NET.</p>
<p>As luck would have it I have been earning a paycheck in the IT industry for the past 13 years, although my passion for computers and technology began at the ripe young age of 6 on an <a href="http://www.atarimuseum.com/computers/8BITS/1200xl/600.html">Atari 600 XL</a>.  I began programming in BASIC on the Atari systems, writing useful utilities like lottery number pickers for my "mom mom".  Later I was introduced to BBSs and ran <a href="http://bbslist.textfiles.com/410/">"House of Pain"</a> (named after the <a href="http://www.cddb.com/search/album_details.php?tui_id=b126afeae081e0e2&amp;tui_tag=">Faster Pussycat </a>song, not the <a href="http://www.cddb.com/artist/artist.php?artist_id=59d997cc57dd76a7">rap band</a>).  I learned Pascal while developing BBS online games, and learned C so I could modify my <a href="http://wwiv.sourceforge.net/">WWIV</a> BBS.  In high school I was introduced to Visual Basic 3.0 and developed an application for the first company I worked for, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961229144326/http://www.upgradeshop.com/">The Upgrade Shop</a>, to enable technicians to custom configure PC's for customers on the sales floor.</p>
<p>I have continued the pursuit of technology nirvana for the past 13 years.  I look forward to the developments that lie ahead, and the opportunity to have a discussion with you through this blog.</p>
