Welcome to my (often neglected) blog!  

I've been in the IT industry for about 20 years now, primarily as a developer.  
A large portion of my career has been spent on Microsoft technologies, as you will
note from the SharePoint-related articles on my site, but more recently I have been
focusing on hybrid mobile application development (hope to get some articles up
on that soon).

In any event, thanks for stopping by, and if you want more information on me
feel free to check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryannapier).
