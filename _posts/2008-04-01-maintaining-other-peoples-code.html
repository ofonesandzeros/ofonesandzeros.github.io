<p>I have taken over maintenance of other people's code in the past, and its generally a mixed-bag.  Sometimes you inherit a plate of spaghetti, sometimes you luck-out and actually get a well architected and implemented codebase.  The real payoff when inheriting maintenance though, is to read the fantastic comments left behind, such as this gem I unearthed today:</p>
{% highlight c# %}
// if it's a number we should sort it descending because it is probably a date
// bad? no, this is AWESOME!!!! Regular expressions are for assholes.
int.Parse(f.SubFolders[0].Name);
dv2 = this.GetFolderViewSorted(f, "DESC");
{% endhighlight %}
