<p>For my own development efforts, I use <a href="http://www.axosoft.com/">Axosoft's</a>&nbsp;OnTime product which is free for&nbsp;a single user (yeah!).&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a single SSL for&nbsp;Axosoft and for my WSS Team Site installation, so I needed for both to coexist peacefully in a single virtual server.&nbsp; Out of the box Axosoft was throwing several errors, at which point&nbsp;I came across this link from Microsoft:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="citation"><cite cite="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/828810"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/828810">How to enable an ASP.Net application to run on a SharePoint virtual server</a></cite></p>
<p>After completing the steps in the article OnTime began working flawlessly!&nbsp; Nice!</p>
