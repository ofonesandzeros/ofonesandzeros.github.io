<p>There are several approaches to adding a ListViewWebPart to a page floating around the Interwebs, and I do believe over the course of the past week I have tried every one of them!  What I intend to do here is to cut to the chase and present the method that worked reliably for my purposes.</p>
<h3>Scenario</h3>
<p>As the title suggests, the scenario is that we are adding a ListViewWebPart to a page, utilizing one of the current list views as a "template", but making some changes for the purposes of this web part.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>I recommend hitting the "view source" button on the syntax highlighter, I really need to switch to a wider blog template :-(.  In any event, here is the solution that I employed, I added numerous comments to describe why things were being done.  Hopefully it saves someone some time.</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="c#"]<br />
            SPLimitedWebPartManager limitedWebPartManager = null;<br />
            ListViewWebPart wp = null;</p>
<p>            try<br />
            {<br />
                // assume that you have a limitedWebPartManager variable containing an<br />
                // instance of a SPLimitedWebPartManager class.</p>
<p>                // also assume that you have a list variable containing a reference to the<br />
                // SPList that you are pointing this ListViewWebPart at.</p>
<p>                // create an instance of the ListViewWebPart<br />
                wp = new ListViewWebPart();<br />
                // convert the list GUID to a string, must include braces (ToString("B")) and be in uppers (ToUpper())<br />
                wp.ListName = list.ID.ToString("B").ToUpper();<br />
                // optionally set the title of the web part<br />
                wp.Title = "I Love List Views";</p>
<p>                // add the web part to the limited web part manager.  when you do this, a "hidden" view will be created<br />
                // on the list referenced by the list variable.  we will later get a reference to this hidden view and bend it<br />
                // to our will.<br />
                limitedWebPartManager.AddWebPart(wp, "whatever web part zone you want to add it to", 1); // the 1 is the index within the zone<br />
                // you need to update the list because a view was just added to it<br />
                list.Update();</p>
<p>                // now that the web part has been added we need to get a fresh reference to it from the limitedWebPartManager.<br />
                // there are plenty of great ways to do this, in this example i will be using the low-tech approach of enumerating the<br />
                // WebParts collection and checking for the type and title that matches our part.  i am quite positive there are more<br />
                // efficient ways of doing this, but this code gets called exactly once every couple months, so efficiency isn't worth<br />
                // the extra development cycles<br />
                foreach (System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart webPart in limitedWebPartManager.WebParts)<br />
                {<br />
                    // check to see if the type of the web part is ListViewWebPart, and if so, check if the title matches our guy.<br />
                    if (webPart is ListViewWebPart &amp;amp;&amp;amp; webPart.Title.Equals("I Love List Views"))<br />
                    {<br />
                        // cast the web part to a ListViewWebPart so we can start to tweak its properties<br />
                        var listViewWebPart = webPart as ListViewWebPart;</p>
<p>                        // here is some of the magic.  the web part now has its ViewGuid property populated which<br />
                        // contains the Guid of the hidden view.  we get a reference to it here.<br />
                        var view = list.Views[new Guid(listViewWebPart.ViewGuid)];</p>
<p>                        // here we grab a reference to a template view.  this may be the default view of the list,<br />
                        // or maybe you have another view that you created that you want to use.  you don't have to<br />
                        // do this, but in this scenario i wanted to copy the filter and sort settings from an existing view.<br />
                        var templateView = list.Views["Name Of Template View"];</p>
<p>                        // now we drop all of the view fields in the hidden view<br />
                        view.ViewFields.DeleteAll();<br />
                        // now we are going to go through a string array and add each of the strings to the view fields collection.  again,<br />
                        // you don't have to do this, but if you want to change what columns are displayed in your ListViewWebPart, you will<br />
                        // need to muck with the ViewFields of the view.<br />
                        Array.ForEach(new string[] { "First Name", "Last Name", "Address" }, f => view.ViewFields.Add(f));</p>
<p>                        // here we copy the Query straight from the templateView.  if you didn't have a templateView you could always<br />
                        // just create an SPQuery instance and assign it to the view.Query property.  no points will be taken off for doing that.<br />
                        view.Query = templateView.Query;</p>
<p>                        // update our hidden view, and bask in the awesomeness of our customized ListViewWebPart<br />
                        view.Update();<br />
                    }<br />
                }<br />
            }<br />
            finally<br />
            {<br />
                // do some fun cleanup of disposable items.  if you are wondering about the .Web.Dispose() bit look for my<br />
                // blog article on the memory leaks in the SPLimitedWebPartManager.<br />
                if (limitedWebPartManager != null)<br />
                {<br />
                    if (limitedWebPartManager.Web != null)<br />
                    {<br />
                        limitedWebPartManager.Web.Dispose();<br />
                    }</p>
<p>                    limitedWebPartManager.Dispose();<br />
                }</p>
<p>                if (wp != null)<br />
                {<br />
                    wp.Dispose();<br />
                }</p>
<p>                // i probably missed some .Dispose()s since I cobbled this code together in Wordpress and not Visual Studio<br />
            }<br />
        }<br />
