    I have been having this problem for months.

    Does the office picture manager return to functionality after you unregister oisctrl.dll?

    TIA

  content: '@Charlie - Unfortunately the Office Picture Manager does not launch, instead
    you see the "normal" upload multiple control, which is the one with the tree view
    on the left and the explorer view on the right.  I have not been able to successfully
    bring the Office Picture Manager back to life, but at least am able to use this
    as a workaround in the meantime.  If you come across a full-scale solution, please
    share!'

    Had same problem, fixed by running Microsoft Office Diagnostics Tool.  It's under START -&gt; Programs -&gt; Microsoft Office -&gt; Microsoft Office Tools -&gt; Microsoft Office Diagnostics.

    It takes about 5 mins to run, depending upon your machine.  Should say 1 or more errors fixed.

  content: This works a treat on Office 2007 machines. Thanks! Any ideas how to do
    the same on Office 2003 machines? I've tried "detect and repair" which is the
    equivalent of Office 2007 diagnostics but to no avail.

<p>There's a title for you!&#160; In any event, a client ha an issue where after clicking &quot;Upload Multiple&quot; in a SharePoint Picture Library, the Microsoft Office Picture Manager would not load.&#160; After digging through the page source, it was determined that SharePoint uses the &quot;OISCTRL.OISClientLauncher&quot; class from the &quot;OISCTRL.dll&quot; to power the Upload Multiple functionality in Picture Libraries.&#160; I wrote the following script to test the functionality of this component on the client machine:</p>
{% highlight c# %}
Set o = CreateObject("OISCTRL.OISClientLauncher")
o.LaunchOIS "ois.exe /upload ""http://sharepointpicturelibraryurl.com"""
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The result was &quot;Unspecified error&quot;.&#160; A further review of the SharePoint javascript indicated that it first looks for &quot;OISCTRL.OISClientLauncher&quot; but if it doesn't find it, it will fall back to good 'ole &quot;STSUPLD.DLL&quot; which powers the standard upload multiple functionality.&#160; For now, we have worked around the issue by unregistering &quot;OISCTRL.dll&quot; which is in the C:Program FilesMicrosoft OfficeOFFICE12 directory:</p>
{% highlight shell %}
regsvr32 /u OISCTRL.dll
{% endhighlight %}
<p>If anyone has an actual fix for OISCTRL.dll not being able to launch the ois.exe process, let me know!</p>
