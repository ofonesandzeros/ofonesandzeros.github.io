<p>If you are using SPS 2003 or MOSS 2007 with a SQL Server 2005 box that does not have SP2 installed, you may discover that your crawls never complete.&nbsp; There is a bug in SQL 2005 that if you have a Reindex Maintenance Plan it clears some attributes of the SharePoint indexes when it reindexes which in turn breaks the search functionality of SharePoint.&nbsp; Long story short, consider SP2 for SQL 2005 to be a system requirement of SharePoint.&nbsp; More information available here:&nbsp; <a title="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930887" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930887">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930887</a></p>
