    Thanks again!

<p>I spent some time on CodePlex today researching the latest open-source SharePoint projects.&#160; I probably haven’t peeked through CodePlex in the past 6 months, and I was very encouraged by the quantity of projects out there.&#160; Following are the ones of particular interest to me:</p>
<p><strong>SharePoint Content Deployment Wizard</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://spdeploymentwizard.codeplex.com/">http://spdeploymentwizard.codeplex.com/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The SharePoint Content Deployment Wizard is a tool for SharePoint 2007 which provides the means to deploy the following content:      <br />- site collections       <br />- webs       <br />- lists       <br />- folders       <br />- list items (including files)       <br />Content is exported using the Content Migration API (PRIME) as a .cmp file (Content Migration Package) which can be copied to other servers for import. Unlike the out-of-the-box tools, the Wizard allows *granular* selection of content via a treeview.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>SharePoint Access Checker Web Part</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://accesschecker.codeplex.com/">http://accesschecker.codeplex.com/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Quickly check what objects within a Sharepoint site hierarchy a user has access to.      </p>
<p>The Access Checker Web Part is a Windows Sharepoint Services Web Part, for use within Windows Sharepoint Services v3 and Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server 2007, that displays a tree view showing permissions on objects for a user scoped to a Site hierarchy. It also has a second mode which will show the permission inheritance of objects within a Site hierarchy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>SharePoint ULS Log Viewer</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://ulsviewer.codeplex.com/">http://ulsviewer.codeplex.com/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A windows application for viewing SharePoint ULS log files more easily. Supports filtering and easy viewing of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="http://i3.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=ULSViewer&amp;DownloadId=48743" width="500" height="259" /> </p>
<p><strong>SLAM! SharePoint List Association Manager</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://slam.codeplex.com/">http://slam.codeplex.com/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Most developers who have used SharePoint as an application development framework have run into the realization that SharePoint is NOT a relational database. In fact, the accepted wisdom is if you need relational tables, use ASP.NET/SQL straight-up, not SharePoint.      </p>
<p>Enter <b>SharePoint List Association Manager</b> (SLAM). In short it allows you to define relationships (one to one, one to many, many to many) between SharePoint lists (or Content Types) and then leverage those relationships in webparts or custom field types using familiar and straight forward SQL queries.</p>

<p><img src="http://i3.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=SLAM&amp;DownloadId=59766" width="500" height="270" /> </p>
<p>Have I missed any?&#160; Please comment if there is a “must have” (except WSPBuilder of course, everyone knows that :-) ) I have omitted!</p>
