<p>Microsoft has released a free version of Expression Encoder which can be used to create screencasts up to 10 minutes in length!&#160; You can include video and audio with the screen cast recording.&#160; I played with this a bit this week and the performance and quality of results are very impressive.&#160; Download it <a href="http://tinyurl.com/pbuv2x">here</a>.</p>
