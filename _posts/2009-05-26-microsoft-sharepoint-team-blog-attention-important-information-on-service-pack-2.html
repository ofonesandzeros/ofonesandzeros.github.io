<p>Microsoftâ€™s SharePoint team has announced that there is a bug in Service Pack 2 for MOSS that will trigger SharePoint to believe it is a trial instance of the product.&#160; A workaround is supplied by Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are working to release a hotfix to automatically fix this issue. A manual work-around is currently available and involves customers re-entering their Product ID number (PID) on the Convert License Type page in Central Administration.&#160; For more information and detailed steps please read this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971620">KB article</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, Microsoft is working on a hotfix to be released shortly.&#160; More information can be found on the Microsoft SharePoint Team Blog:</p>
