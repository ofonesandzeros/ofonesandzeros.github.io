<p>I've been in the habit the past few weeks of leaving items in my pockets which end up on an adventure through the washing machine.&#160; The latest participant was my PNY Attache 1G USB Flash drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www2.ofonesandzeros.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/attache1.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="240" alt="attache" src="http://www2.ofonesandzeros.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/attache-thumb1.jpg" width="195" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>I thought for certain it was a goner.&#160; I left it on my desk overnight to dry out and gave it a shot this morning, wha-la!&#160; Came right up with my <a href="http://portableapps.com/">Portable Apps</a> menu.&#160; Very cool!</p>
