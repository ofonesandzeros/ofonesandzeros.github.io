<p>Just to see if it would work, I decided the other day to pair my Motorola HS3 Bluetooth Headset with my Lenovo Thinkpad T60.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I am really digging using my headset with Google Talk and Messenger. I like having the option to switch into a voice chat from IM but maintain a form of privacy by using the headset. I think I'll leave my headset paired with my computer and leave my phone out of it!</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Okay, I paved my laptop the other day and installed Vista, now I no longer have a working Bluetooth headset!  Apparently the Bluetooth stack in Vista does not include the drivers to support a Bluetooth headset :-(.</p>
