    Thanks,

    This is the exact same problem we faced. This is really weird...

<p>My customer has a requirement to track the last login date/time for each SharePoint user so that they can disable accounts that have not had any activity for a time period.  I decided to implement this requirement by creating an HttpHandler and tying a jQuery .post call into the custom masterpage.  The HttpHandler would then update a property, LastLogin, that has been added to the user profile service application.</p>
<p>The issue I ran into is that SharePoint would constantly complain about not allowing updates via a GET, and that I needed to set the AllowUnsafeUpdates property on the SPWeb object.  Sounds simple and straight forward enough, and oddly this was an instance where not only did SharePoint give you a decent error, it even went so far as to propose a solution!  Double word score!  Unfortunately it took forever to figure out WHICH SPWeb object it was talking about!  Check out the following code:</p>
<p>{% highlight c# %}
private void UpdateUserLastLogin(HttpContext context)
{
    string siteURL = SPContext.Current.Site.Url;
    SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivileges(delegate()
    {
        using (SPSite site = new SPSite(SPContext.Current.Site.ID))
        using (SPWeb web = site.OpenWeb(SPContext.Current.Web.ID))
        {
            // this is the important bit
            SPContext.Current.Site.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;
            SPContext.Current.Web.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;
            SPServiceContext serviceContext = SPServiceContext.GetContext(site);
            UserProfileManager profileManager = new UserProfileManager(serviceContext);
            UserProfile profile;
            if (!profileManager.UserExists(SPContext.Current.Web.CurrentUser.LoginName))
            {
                profile = profileManager.CreateUserProfile(SPContext.Current.Web.CurrentUser.LoginName);
            }
            else
            {
                profile = profileManager.GetUserProfile(SPContext.Current.Web.CurrentUser.LoginName);
            }
            profile["LastLogin"].Value = DateTime.Now;
            profile.Commit();
            SPContext.Current.Web.AllowUnsafeUpdates = false;
            SPContext.Current.Site.AllowUnsafeUpdates = false;
        }
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>So if you look at the part commented "This is the important bit" you will see AllowUnsafeUpdates getting set.  This is what I finally came to which actually worked.  Previously I tried the following:</p>
<p>{% highlight c# %}
site.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;
web.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>And that did not work at all.  So I'm still not completely clear why setting it on the SPContext.Current.Web works, considering that I am spinning up new instances of SPSite and SPWeb and sending them to UserProfileManager, but whatever.  I'll take it.</p>
<p>If anyone can explain why this works that would be awesome, in the meantime I'll keep this handy incase I run across this dreaded error in the future.</p>
