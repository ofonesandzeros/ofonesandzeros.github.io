    Thanks,

    This is the exact same problem we faced. This is really weird...

<p>My customer has a requirement to track the last login date/time for each SharePoint user so that they can disable accounts that have not had any activity for a time period.  I decided to implement this requirement by creating an HttpHandler and tying a jQuery .post call into the custom masterpage.  The HttpHandler would then update a property, LastLogin, that has been added to the user profile service application.</p>
<p>The issue I ran into is that SharePoint would constantly complain about not allowing updates via a GET, and that I needed to set the AllowUnsafeUpdates property on the SPWeb object.  Sounds simple and straight forward enough, and oddly this was an instance where not only did SharePoint give you a decent error, it even went so far as to propose a solution!  Double word score!  Unfortunately it took forever to figure out WHICH SPWeb object it was talking about!  Check out the following code:</p>
<p>[code language="c#"]<br />
private void UpdateUserLastLogin(HttpContext context)<br />
        {<br />
            string siteURL = SPContext.Current.Site.Url;</p>
<p>            SPSecurity.RunWithElevatedPrivileges(delegate()<br />
            {<br />
                using (SPSite site = new SPSite(SPContext.Current.Site.ID))<br />
                using (SPWeb web = site.OpenWeb(SPContext.Current.Web.ID))<br />
                {</p>
<p>                    // this is the important bit<br />
                    SPContext.Current.Site.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;<br />
                    SPContext.Current.Web.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;</p>
<p>                    SPServiceContext serviceContext = SPServiceContext.GetContext(site);<br />
                    UserProfileManager profileManager = new UserProfileManager(serviceContext);</p>
<p>                    UserProfile profile;</p>
<p>                    if (!profileManager.UserExists(SPContext.Current.Web.CurrentUser.LoginName))<br />
                    {<br />
                        profile = profileManager.CreateUserProfile(SPContext.Current.Web.CurrentUser.LoginName);<br />
                    }<br />
                    else<br />
                    {<br />
                        profile = profileManager.GetUserProfile(SPContext.Current.Web.CurrentUser.LoginName);<br />
                    }</p>
<p>                    profile["LastLogin"].Value = DateTime.Now;</p>
<p>                    profile.Commit();</p>
<p>                    SPContext.Current.Web.AllowUnsafeUpdates = false;<br />
                    SPContext.Current.Site.AllowUnsafeUpdates = false;<br />
                }<br />
            });<br />
        }<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>So if you look at the part commented "This is the important bit" you will see AllowUnsafeUpdates getting set.  This is what I finally came to which actually worked.  Previously I tried the following:</p>
<p>[code language="C#"]<br />
site.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;<br />
web.AllowUnsafeUpdates = true;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And that did not work at all.  So I'm still not completely clear why setting it on the SPContext.Current.Web works, considering that I am spinning up new instances of SPSite and SPWeb and sending them to UserProfileManager, but whatever.  I'll take it.</p>
<p>If anyone can explain why this works that would be awesome, in the meantime I'll keep this handy incase I run across this dreaded error in the future.</p>
