<p>First, I saw the announcement of <a href="http://www.pandora.com/on-windowsmobile">Pandora on Windows Mobile</a>.&#160; Very cool.</p>
<p>Then, I was listening to Pandora while working, like I pretty much always do, and over in the &quot;ads&quot; section of the screen there were 2 links.&#160; One for the Windows Mobile download, and one for a Vista Gadget.&#160; There have been some 3rd party gadgets in the past that I really weren't too thrilled with, but this little guy is great:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't find the darn link again to include in this post!&#160; If I see it pop up again, I'll update this post to include the link.&#160; Otherwise, just hit refresh a bunch of times and its bound to show up at some point!</p>
<p>Ho, ho, ho!&#160; Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (12/17/2008 9:07PM ET): </strong>Ah hah!&#160; Finally have <a href="http://www.pandora.com/on-windowsgadget">the link</a> for the official Vista Gadget!&#160; Enjoy!</p>
<p>Also, tonight was the first opportunity that I had to test streaming Pandora through my Q9H to my <a href="http://www.syncmyride.com">Microsoft SYNC</a> equipped Ford Explorer (using Bluetooth Stereo Headset support on the stereo).&#160; I was very impressed with the stability of the signal.&#160; I drove for about 40 minutes from Annapolis, MD to Centreville, MD with no drops or stutter (3G the whole way).&#160; The audio quality is not great, it's slightly worse than Sirius Satellite Radio.&#160; Not sure how often I will end up using it, but its definitely cool to have the ability.</p>
