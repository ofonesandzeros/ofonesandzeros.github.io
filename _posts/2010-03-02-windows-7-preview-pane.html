<p>First off, I didn't even realize that Vista had a Preview Pane feature, but today I had the need to quickly glance through several Word documents and was trying to find a way to quickly preview the contents.  I noticed an icon within Explorer in the upper right that looked like a preview button and wha-la!  I haven't tried for other file types yet but for Word documents the experience is fantastic.</p>
