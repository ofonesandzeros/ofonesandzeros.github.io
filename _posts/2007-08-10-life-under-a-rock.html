<p>My family and I are having a new house built.  Seems appropriate, as my former abode was located under the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://www2.ofonesandzeros.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/big-rock1.jpg"><img style="border: 0px;" src="http://www2.ofonesandzeros.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/big-rock-thumb1.jpg" border="0" alt="Big Rock" width="449" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>You think I'm kidding?  I assure you I am not.  And I offer as proof this tidbit:</p>
<p>Did you know that since Windows 2000 one could mount drives to a folder?  Chances are, you did know that.  Or, you were one of my neighbors.  Did I know that?  I vaguely remembered it, but was absolutely appalled that I have never put it to use. </p>
<p>Okay, maybe you are in the dark ages with me (please say it is so!), the following article contains additional information:</p>
<p><a title="http://pctoday.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/2005/t0306/06t06/06t06.asp&amp;guid=" href="http://pctoday.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/2005/t0306/06t06/06t06.asp&amp;guid=">http://pctoday.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/2005/t0306/06t06/06t06.asp&amp;guid=</a></p>
<p>I will not take this second chance at mount points lightly.  I am going to emerge from the dark ages of drive letters, I am going to install MOSS 2007 using mount points, and the world will rejoice! </p>
<p>Stay tuned.  (or return to your rock)</p>
