<p>One of our SharePoint servers at work was updated with the most recent round of security patches the other day.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the result of this update was the inability to login to the SharePoint Portal from the server, and the search crawler not being able to access the site.</p>
<p>After some significant research on the matter I came across <a title="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896861</a>&nbsp;which indicates that an IIS website that is using Integrated Windows Authentication and the URL is different from the computer name, will result in a 401.1 error.&nbsp; The fix is to add the other names of the computer into a registry key and restart IIS.&nbsp; After following the instructions in the knowledge base article I was able to login to the site from the server, and the search crawler was once again able to crawl the content.</p>
