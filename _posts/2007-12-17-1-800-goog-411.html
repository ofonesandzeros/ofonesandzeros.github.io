<p>If you haven't checked out 1-800-GOOG-411 yet, you should.&nbsp; It is 100% voice recognition driven directory assistance (wow that was a mouthful).&nbsp; You call up, it asks for the location.&nbsp; It will then respond back with how it heard the location and you can confirm.&nbsp; It will then ask for either a category or business name.&nbsp; Once you state it, it will begin to respond with search results.&nbsp; When you hear a result that you like, you tell it the number and it will connect you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The best part of all is that the service is completely free!&nbsp; No more $1.00 411 calls!&nbsp; Check it out next time you get ready to dial 411.</p>
