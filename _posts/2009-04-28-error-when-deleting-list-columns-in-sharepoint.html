<p>“Unable to validate data.”</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://roadburn.audioreload.com/">Angela Chng</a> for <a href="http://roadburn.audioreload.com/2008/12/03/sharepoint-2007-unknown-error-when-deleting-list-columns/">the solution:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Did you customize your application master pages and get this error while trying to delete list columns? </p>
<p>Unable to validate data. at System.Web.Configuration.MachineKeySection.GetDecodedData(Byte[] buf, Byte[] modifier, Int32 start, Int32 length, Int32&amp; dataLength)&#160;&#160; <br />at System.Web.UI.ObjectStateFormatter.Deserialize(String inputString)&#160; </p>
<p>Ok that probably means you have a search box in the template which is messing things up, just remove it or hide it, and that will do the trick!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removed the search box from the application.master and the issue was resolved!</p>
