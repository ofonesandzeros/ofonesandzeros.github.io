<p>Found a great new trick today for mounting Virtual PC VHD files as drives within the host operating system.&#160; In the Virtual Server 2005 R2 SP1 installer is a utility called &quot;VHDMount&quot;.&#160; If you install Virtual Server you can elect to only install this utility (if you do a custom install).&#160; This will create a directory &quot;[drive]:Program FilesMicrosoft Virtual ServerVHDMount&quot; within it is a file called VHDMount.exe.&#160; This is a command-line utility that you can use to mount your VHD files.&#160; I regularly use a VHD drive that I share with multiple VPC's that has common development utilities, and being able to populate that drive without having to boot up one of the VPC's as a big plus. </p>
