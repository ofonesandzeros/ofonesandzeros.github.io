<p>So a few months ago I scrapped my Blackberry 8700 and got a Motorola Q Global (one of the cool slate gray ones):</p>
<p><a href="http://www2.ofonesandzeros.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/motorola-moto-q9-l1.gif"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="374" alt="motorola_moto_q9_l" src="http://www2.ofonesandzeros.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/motorola-moto-q9-l-thumb1.gif" width="228" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>All in all I am pretty happy with the phone.&#160; I love the form factor, its very slim so it fits well in your pocket, and its wide so my chubby digits can get an e-mail out with a minimum of type-os.&#160; </p>
<p>In any event, the intent of this post is not to provide a review of my new phone, but rather to talk about one of my favorite new blogs:&#160; <a href="http://www.msmobiles.com">msmobiles.com</a>.&#160; Admittedly, not the most attractive web site on the planet, but they do a fantastic job at providing info on the latest developments in the world of Windows Mobile.&#160; </p>
<p>One of their postings today has gotten me excited:&#160; <a href="http://msmobiles.com/news.php/7882.html">Windows Mobile catches up with iPhone and Android: Street View released by Google !</a>&#160; They have screen shots of the Google Maps update including the Street View functionality. </p>
<p>I haven't downloaded the update yet, but within about the next 15 minutes I intend to.</p>
