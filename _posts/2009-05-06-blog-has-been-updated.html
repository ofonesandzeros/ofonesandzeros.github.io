  content: Are you saying that the font color <strong>should</strong> be changed?  I
    can see that the contrast is pretty low.

  content: You can either change font color or make search box back color little darker
    and have little bit higher contrast between back and fore color.

<p>This blog was in desperate need of an update, aesthetically and infrastructure related. If memory serves, coming into yesterday Of Ones and Zeros was running on Wordpress 2.3, and hadnâ€™t received any TLC so to speak in the past 18 months. Initially I was planning to move this blog over to the excellent <a href="http://www.sitefinity.com">Sitefinity</a> platform by <a href="http://www.telerik.com">telerik</a>, but I had a last moment change of heart and elected to stay with <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. </p>
<p>So a couple interesting bits with the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded to WordPress 2.7.1</li>
<li>Hosting has been moved to <a href="http://www.providicom.com">Providicom</a></li>
<li>UI has been completely updated (thanks to <a href="http://www.woothemes.com">WooThemes</a> for their excellent premium WordPress themes)</li>
<li>My latest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">tweet</a> is incorporated into the banner of the blog, and you can click the bird icon to follow me on Twitter</li>
<li>Using the excellent <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter">SyntaxHighlighter</a> javascript by Alex Gorbatchev to make code segments on the blog readable</li>
<li>Incorporated latest <a href="http://delicious.com/ofonesandzeros">delicious</a> books into the sidebar</li>
<li>Support for <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> and threaded comments</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy the update and please let me know if you have additional ideas for Of Ones and Zeros. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
