<p>Came in the office today to an issue with a MOSS box that was recently stood up in our lab environment.&#160; The server was configured to do automatic updates, and installed SharePoint updates overnight.&#160; Turns out the upgrade portion of the update failed, and perusing the diagnostic logs revealed the following error:</p>
<blockquote><p><font style="background-color: #ffffff">Cannot start service SPAdmin on computer '.'</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I came across the following blog posting that ultimately supplied the remedy:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/wbaer/archive/2007/10/15/kb934525-troubleshooting.aspx">Bill Baer : KB934525 Troubleshooting &quot;Cannot start service SPAdmin on computer '.'.&quot;</a> </p>
<p>Option #4 took care of things:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>On the machine where psconfig failed to start the SPAdmin service run:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><code>%commonprogramfiles%Microsoft SharedWeb Server Extensions12BINpsconfig -cmd upgrade -inplace b2b -wait -force</code></p></blockquote>
