<p>While vacationing down in the Florida keys I took a short two hour drive up to The Falls shopping center in Miami to pickup a 32 GB ipad!  First impressions are very positive. The device has a very snappy feel, much more responsive when browsing the internet than on my 3GS (which consequently I also love). The only negative at the moment is the lack of apps support for the ipad. Many of my favorites have not yet been optimized for the iPad, and while they work in iPhone compatibility mode, the fact that a hundredth of the ipads screen real estate gets used is disappointing. I am sure now that the device is shipping it will not be long before the apps follow. </p>
