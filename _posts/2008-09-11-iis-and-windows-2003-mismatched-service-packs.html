<p>I have this nagging feeling that I have been down this road before, so I need to blog it so maybe, just maybe, I won't waste another hour troubleshooting something I've done before.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>You browse to Central Admin, or any Site Collection really, and you are prompted incessantly for  your user credentials.  After about 5-8 times, the page comes up.  You are NOT presented with a Forbidden message.</p>
<p>You check your IIS log files, and you see several 401 errors for WebResource.axd.</p>
<p>You remember something about installing SP2 when IIS wasn't on the box, then installing IIS from a source that did not have the Service Pack slipstreamed.  Hmmm.  Might be relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Explained thoroughly by Paul Culmsee on his blog <a href="http://www.cleverworkarounds.com">www.cleverworkarounds.com</a>, <a href="http://www.cleverworkarounds.com/2007/11/15/darn-iis-and-service-packs/">http://www.cleverworkarounds.com/2007/11/15/darn-iis-and-service-packs/</a>.  If it wasn't foreshadowed by the last sentence of the Scenario, reinstalling Windows Server 2003 SP2 was the solution.</p>
