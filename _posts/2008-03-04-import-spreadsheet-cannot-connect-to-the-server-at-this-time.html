<p>Ran into an issue today with trying to import an Excel 2003 spreadsheet into a SharePoint list.&#160; SharePoint would load Excel, then you select the cells in Excel that you want to import, you click Import and Excel responds with &quot;Cannot connect to the server at this time.&quot;&#160; After a long while searching for a solution, I came across the following link: </p>
<p><a href="http://wss.asaris.de/sites/walsh/Lists/WSS%20FAQ/DispForm.aspx?ID=188&amp;Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwss%2Easaris%2Ede%2Fsites%2Fwalsh%2FLists%2FWSS%2520FAQ%2FIII%2520Administration%2Easpx">WSS FAQ - I cannot import from Excel 2003 to WSS. What's...</a> </p>
<p>Basically the solution was 2 workarounds:</p>
<p>a.) Import the spreadsheet into a root site, then create a list template and use that to create the list within a subsite.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b.) Use Excel's List Publishing feature to publish directly to the subsite.</p>
<p>I tested both options and they each worked equally well, I ultimately went with option B as it seemed a cleaner solution.</p>
