<p>Had an issue today where a developer was testing a web part that required a user profile, and an exception was being thrown that the user profile did not exist.&#160; We verified in the SSP that the user profile indeed existed, and also used the &quot;stsadm -o sync&quot; command to force a profile synchronization.&#160; However, we discovered that SharePoint was not seeing the actual user name that the user was logged in as, instead SharePoint saw it as &quot;SHAREPOINTSystem&quot;.&#160; This led us to the following forum thread:</p>
<p> <a title="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1195418&amp;SiteID=1" href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1195418&amp;SiteID=1">http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1195418&amp;SiteID=1</a>
<p>What ended up being the issue is that the developer had configured the SharePoint application pool to run as the same identity that he was logging into SharePoint as.&#160; We changed the configured identity in Central Admin -&gt; Operations -&gt; Service Accounts to use Network Service instead and the issue was resolved.</p>
