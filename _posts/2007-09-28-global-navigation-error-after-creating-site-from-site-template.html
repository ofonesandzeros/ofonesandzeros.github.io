<p>Follow along:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new site template from SharePoint Designer.&nbsp; Doesn't really matter what the site template is for or what options you choose (based on my experience).</li>
<li>Go into SharePoint and create a new site based on the new custom Site Template.</li>
<li>Note that your top navigation bar (the global navigation) should now have a "Home" tab, and an "Error" tab.</li>
<li>Click refresh.</li>
<li>Your top navigation bar now appears as normal!</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll chalk this one up as a "feature".</p>
